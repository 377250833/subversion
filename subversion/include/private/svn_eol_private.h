 * @a len bytes in @a buf.
 *
 * If the last valid character of @a buf is the first byte of a
 * potentially two-byte eol sequence, just return that single-character
 * sequence, that is, assume @a buf represents a CR-only or LF-only file.
 * This is correct for callers that pass an entire file at once, and is
 * no more likely to be incorrect than correct for any caller that doesn't.
 *
 * The returned string is statically allocated, i.e. it is NOT a pointer
 * to an address within @a buf.
 *
 * If an eol marker is found and @a eolp is not NULL, store in @a *eolp
 * the address within @a buf of the first byte of the eol marker.
 * This allows callers to tell whether there might be more than one eol
 * sequence in @a buf, as well as detect two-byte eol sequences that
 * span buffer boundaries.

 * If it cannot be detected, set @a *eol to NULL.
 *
 * The file is searched starting at the current file cursor position.
 * The first EOL marker found will be returned. So if the file has
 * inconsistent EOL markers, this won't be detected.
 *
 * Upon return, the original file cursor position is always preserved,
 * even if an error is thrown.
 *
 * The string @a *eol is statically allocated.
 * Do temporary allocations in @a pool.

 * ### [JAF] Apparent bug: implementation suffers from the "one byte of a
 *     two-byte sequence" issue noted for svn_eol__detect_eol().
 *
 * ### [JAF] Apparent bug: if file pointer is at EOF, returns "success"
 *     without initializing @a *eol.
 *
 * ### [JAF] Wouldn't it make more sense to accept a stream than a file?
